  """Model that adds a loss component to another model during training.

  Inherits from: `tf.keras.Model`

  Arguments:
    original_model: Instance of `tf.keras.Model` that will be trained with the
      additional `min_diff_loss`.
    loss: String (name of loss) or `min_diff.losses.MinDiffLoss` instance that
      will be used to calculate the `min_diff_loss`.
    loss_weight: Scalar applied to the `min_diff_loss` before being included
      in training.
    predictions_transform: Optional if the output of `original_model` is a
      `tf.Tensor`. Function that transforms the output of `original_model` after
      it is called on MinDiff examples. The resulting predictions tensor is
      what will be passed in to the `losses.MinDiffLoss`.
    **kwargs: Named parameters that will be passed directly to the base
      class' `__init__` function.

  `MinDiffModel` wraps the model passed in, `original_model`, and adds a
  component to the loss during training and optionally during evaluation.

  ### <a id=constructing_mindiffmodel></a>Construction

  There are two ways to construct a `MinDiffModel` instance, the first is the
  simplest and the most common:

  1 - Directly wrap your model with `MinDiffModel`. This is the simplest usage
  and is most likely what you will want to use (unless your original model has
  some custom implementations that need to be taken into account).

  ```
  import tensorflow as tf

  model = tf.keras.Sequential([...])

  model = MinDiffModel(model, ...)
  ```

  In this case, all methods other than the ones listed below will use the
  default implementations of `tf.keras.Model`.

  If you are in this use case, the next section is not relevant to you and you
  skip to the section on [usage](#using_mindiffmodel).


  2 - Subclassing `MinDiffModel` to integrate custom implementations. This will
  likely be needed if the original_model is itself a customized subclass of
  `tf.keras.Model`. If that is the case and you want to preserve the custom
  implementations, you can create a new custom class that inherits first from
  `MinDiffModel` and second from your custom class.

  ```
  import tensorflow as tf

  class CustomSequential(tf.keras.Sequential):

    def train_step(self, data):
      print("In a custom train_step!")
      super().train_step(data)

  class CustomMinDiffModel(MinDiffModel, CustomSequential):
    pass  # No additional implementation is required.

  model = CustomSequential([...])

  model = CustomMinDiffModel(model, ...)  # This will use the custom train_step.
  ```

  If you need to customize methods defined by `MinDiffModel`, then you can
  create a direct subclass and override whatever is needed.

  ```
  import tensorflow as tf

  class CustomMinDiffModel(MinDiffModel):

    def unpack_min_diff_data(self, inputs):
      print("In a custom MinDiffModel method!")
      super().unpack_min_diff_data(inputs)

  model = tf.keras.Sequential([...])

  model = CustomMinDiffModel(model, ...)  # This will use the custom
                                          # unpack_min_diff_data method.
  ```

  ### <a id=using_mindiffmodel></a>Usage

  Once you have created an instance of `MinDiffModel`, it can be used almost
  exactly the same way as the model it wraps. The main two exceptions to this
  are:

  - During training, the inputs must include `min_diff_data`, see
    `MinDiffModel.compute_min_diff_loss` for details.
  - Saving and loading a model has slightly different behavior. See
    `MinDiffModel.save` and `MinDiffModel.save_original_model` for details.

  Optionally, inputs containing `min_diff_data` can be passed in to `evaluate`
  and `predict`. For the former, this will result in the `min_diff_loss`
  appearing in the metrics. For `predict` this should have no visible effect.

    Like the input requirements described in `tf.keras.Model.fit`,
    `min_diff_data` must be a tuple of length 2 or 3. The tuple will be unpacked

    min_diff_x, min_diff_membership, min_diff_sample_weight = (
        tf.keras.utils.unpack_x_y_sample_weight(min_diff_data))
    ```
    The components are defined as follows:

    - `min_diff_x`: inputs to `original_model` to get the corresponding MinDiff
      predictions.
    - `min_diff_membership`: numerical [batch_size, 1] `Tensor` indicating which
      group each example comes from (marked as `0.0` or `1.0`).
    - `min_diff_sample_weight`: Optional weight `Tensor`. The weights will be
      applied to the examples during the `min_diff_loss` calculation.

    The `min_diff_loss` is ultimately calculated from the MinDiff
    predictions which are evaluated in the following way:

    ```
    ...  # In compute_min_diff_loss call.

    min_diff_x = ...  # Single batch of MinDiff examples.

    # Get predictions for MinDiff examples.
    min_diff_predictions = self.original_model(min_diff_x, training=training)

    Note: Like `tf.keras.Model.call`, this method should not be called directly.
    To call a model on an input, always use the `__call__` method,
    i.e. `model(inputs)`, which relies on the `call` method internally.

    This method should be used the same way as `tf.keras.Model.call`. Depending
    on whether you are in train mode, `inputs` may need to include
    `min_diff_data` (see `MinDiffModel.compute_min_diff_data` for details on
    what form that needs to take).

    - If `training=True`: `inputs` must contain `min_diff_data` (see details
      below).
    - If `training=False`: including `min_diff_data` is optional.

    If present, the `min_diff_loss` is added by calling `self.add_loss` and will
    show up in `self.losses`.

    `MinDiffModel.unpack_original_inputs` and
    `MinDiffModel.unpack_min_diff_data` behave as expected when called on
    `inputs` (see methods for details).
