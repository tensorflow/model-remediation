  """MinDiffLoss abstract base class.

  Inherits from: `tf.keras.losses.Loss`

  Arguments:
    membership_transform: Transform function used on `membership`. If `None` is
      passed in then `membership` is left as is. The function must return a
      `tf.Tensor`.
    predictions_transform: Transform function used on `predictions`. If `None`
      is passed in then `predictions` is left as is. The function must return
      a `tf.Tensor`.
    membership_kernel: String (name of kernel) or
      `min_diff.losses.MinDiffKernel` to be applied on `membership`. If `None`
      is passed in, then `membership` is left untouched when applying kernels.
    predictions_kernel: String (name of kernel) or
      `min_diff.losses.MinDiffKernel` to be applied on `predictions`. If `None`
      is passed in, then `predictions` is left untouched when applying kernels.
    name: Name used for logging and tracking.

  To be implemented by subclasses:

  - `call()`: Contains the logic for loss calculation using
    `membership`, `predictions` and optionally `sample_weight`.

  Example subclass implementation:

  ```
  class MyMinDiffLoss(MinDiffLoss):

    def call(membership, predictions, sample_weight=None):
      loss = ...  # Internal logic to calculate loss.
      return loss
  ```

  A `MinDiffLoss` instance measures the difference in prediction scores
  (typically score distributions) between two groups of examples identified by
  the value in the `membership` column.

  If the predictions between the two groups are indistinguishable, the loss
  should be 0. The more different the two scores are, the higher the loss.
