  """MinDiffKernel abstract base class.

  Arguments:
    tile_input: Boolean indicating whether to tile inputs before computing the
      kernel (see below for details).

  To be implemented by subclasses:

  - `call()`: contains the logic for the kernel tensor calculation.

  Example subclass Implementation:

  ```
  class GuassKernel(MinDiffKernel):

    def call(x, y):
      return tf.exp(-tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(x - y), axis=2) / 0.01)
  ```

  "Tiling" is a way of expanding the rank of the input tensors so that their
  dimensions work for the operations we need.

  If `x` and `y` are of rank `[N, D]` and `[M, D]` respectively, tiling expands
  them to be: `[N, ?, D]` and `[?, M, D]` where `tf` broadcasting will ensure
  that the operations between them work.

      y: Optional `tf.Tensor` of shape `[M, D]` (if tiling input) or `[N, M, D]`

    If `y` is `None`, it is set to be the same as `x`:
