This guide assumes there is a problematic gap in the FNR (false negative rate) between `\"Male\"` and `\"Female\"` slices and the model owner (you) has decided to apply MinDiff to address the issue. For more information on the scenarios in which one might choose to apply MinDiff, see the [requirements page](https://www.tensorflow.org/responsible_ai/model_remediation/min_diff/guide/requirements).\n",
